# Gender-Classification-Machine-Learning
Apply multiple machine learning algorithms on gender classification dataset and justify the algorithm that predicts the gender with highest accuracy.The dataset used is retrieved from Kaggle. 

The machine learning algorithms used are:
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machine


The hyperparameter tuning technique used in the project is GridSearch.   
The algorithm that has the best performance is **Random Forest**.
